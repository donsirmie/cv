  <p> <em> Navigating my way through life </em> </p>
  <p>i am a 25 years old confused boy who still doesnt know for sure if he can get what he wants in life</p>

  perharps i have my hopes and expectations set too high. I'm rcently learning how to code on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12287450#overview">udemy</a>, currently in the html phase as you
  can see this website is in basic html format. <p>i don't really know for sure if it's coding or writing per se but i hope it brings me some relief</p>

        Where i am at life right now </u> </center>
  </h2>
  i am a medical student studying overseas far away from home. you might think all i have is roses, well you were right only if you thought so a few years....not exactly that life gave me roses but i must say ive been comfortable and worryless. <p>
    what's this section about again? you see. thats just me...so many thoughts flowing through my head at the same time, sometimes i even get lost in my thoughts.</p>
  i'm in my final year in medical school. someone said i should be very happy about that, but how can i be happy when i just got suspended from intership because i haven't paid my school fees? i am just 2 months away from gruaduation. don't blame my
  school, i haven't paid from 3 straight year. <p>don't blame me too because i am a student and i can't afford my own tuition. don't blame my parents they are having it tougher than i am. my mom has been sick for 3 straight year, my dad is retired.
    he has been taking care of my ill mom for three straight years non-stop. my mom used to work for the prison service, she is infact a deputy controller of prisons and should be a controller if not an assistance controller general as of now. my dad
    retired as a school principal. you might be thinking with that status my family shouldn't get blown off by some troubles just like that....i will say that's a thought of a lucky person who hasn't experienced anything tough....and i hope you never
    do!
    yes, my mom got sick, we used up almost all savings trying to get her treatment and staying afloat as well so my school fees couldn't be paid and the school management ran out of patience. i still remember the director telling me if everyone will
    be allowed to study without fees how will they pay the teachers and how will the families of the teachers survive? he's right.
  <p>i've had my worries even before the school suspended my internship. i met the most beautiful girl in the world rigth here and i will like to spend the rest of my life together her. i wish i can become rich right now so i can tell her family
    bodly how well i will take good care of their daughter. i always get lost in my own thoughts imagining how wealthty i become, businesses i own, how many people ive sponsored i school, families ive catered for, those who i have paid their
    healthcare bills, how much of a blessing i am to my generation. aren't you shocked i didnt mention being a doctor in my thoughts? i think i have more to do than being a doctor. i can't save much lives being a doctor with a very tight schedule but
    i can save and impact lot more lives as a free enterprenuer who's cheerful. i'm mostly keen on tech, i am a lover of technology. i've not been idle, i have a lot of projects planned out in my notebook but there's always one thing or the other
    keeoing me from achieving. i don't plan on being a doctor but i might end up working as a doctor, look i dont really know where i am headed in life. i told my gf i might need to go work as a doctor for about 5 years to raise enough capital to
    start my dreams. i am confused. i dont really voice my concerns out to nobody i like to appear happy everytime so as not to make people around me worried but the truth is its killing me.
  <p>perhaps it's the worries are a result of the phase where i am in life, full just between being a student and fulltime adulthood. maybe im just nervous about finding my place in life. maybe i'm worrying a little too early. maybe i should take it
    one worry at a time. maybe i have to wait till i graduate before worrying about my place in life. maybe i'm just being too impatient, maybe things will get solved on their own if i wait a little longer i dont know, i really dont know.</p> i hope
  sharing it with you can bring me some relief. i hope someone somewhere going through thesame phase as me finds some solace. i hope one day if you ever get worried you can share it here as well. . </p>
  damn i suck at both writing and web designing!
